# Profiler
Meal Profile Editor:  The goal is to allow folks to store various meals based on their health goal(s).  The program does some rudimentary calculation for the user and returns the results to the viewport.  The Meal Options menu contains the create function, and the index cshtml contains the read, edit, and delete functions.


To run:  Download the directory and look for the .sln file.  Double click it and then f5 to build and run inside of Visual Studio.
